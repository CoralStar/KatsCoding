              <h4>Snork's Bubble Trouble</h4>
              <p>Snork's Bubble Trouble was created in 2020 in Unity. <br>The project consists of artwork, scripting, and design by me. Music was created by my friend JPhelpz. This game is still being worked on with the intent to be on Mac computers, Android, and iPhones.
              <br>Play as the adorable, orange seahorse named Snork who battles his way through fierce predators to save his girlfriend. This game also has a Fun Facts sections so players can learn more about the characters and their real life equivalent.</p>

            <h4>Tiki the Sea Turtle</h4>
            <p>Created back in late 2019, Tiki the Sea Turtle was the first ever game I had coded in Unity and launched onto the Google Play Store. <br>The idea originated from an online class on Udemy and with my own creative spin, and help from a friend, the game came into being.
            <br>The game teaches kids about the dangers of trash in our oceans through a fun arcade-styled game. Your goal is to guide Tiki to the jellyfish and away from eating the plastic in the water.</p>

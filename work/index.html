              <p>Snork's Bubble Trouble was created in 2020 in Unity. <br>The project consists of artwork, scripting, and design by me. Music was created by my friend JPhelpz. This game is still being worked on with the intent to be on Mac computers, Android, and iPhones.
              <br>Play as the adorable, orange seahorse named Snork who battles his way through fierce predators to save his girlfriend. This game also has a Fun Facts sections so players can learn more about the characters and their real life equivalent.</p>

            <h4>Tiki the Sea Turtle</h4>
            <p>Created back in late 2019, Tiki the Sea Turtle was the first ever game I had coded in Unity and launched onto the Google Play Store. <br>The idea originated from an online class on Udemy and with my own creative spin, and help from a friend, the game came into being.
            <br>The game teaches kids about the dangers of trash in our oceans through a fun arcade-styled game. Your goal is to guide Tiki to the jellyfish and away from eating the plastic in the water.</p>

          <p>Back in 2013 I found this online, 3D-styled, chatlands game where you could make your own worlds, objects, presets, etc.<br>
            I started doing level design as a hobby, creating stories behind these lands, and by 2015 (at age 16) I was one of the game's most popular Map Makers.<br>
            In 2018, I was asked by the Devs to work on their latest update. Now my name is in the game's credits section and my creations can be seen in-game.<br> Here is just the highlights of my favorite projects for this game.</p>

            <h3>Sea of Thieves Game Testing</h3>
            <p>Back in 2017 I had the pleasure of being selected as one of the thousand players to help in the Alpha testing of Sea of Thieves. For every game session I got to play in I would try to send in a minimum of three bug reports.<br>
              Since Alpha, I was invited back for the Pioneer Program during their launch of the Devil's Roar expansion. The game has recently opened the testing servers up to everyone, but its nice to say I was one the firsts to test and help out.</p>

            <p>In 2019, I published a website for First Baptist Church of DeSoto, TX. I've been mantaining the website every week, keeping it up to date on events and online sermons.</p>

            <h3>The Cutthroat Pirates</h3>
            <p>I joined this online community back in December of 2018. The group was designed to be a gaming community for the game Sea of Thieves. In my years of being with them, I have moved up the ranks to later become the community's Event Council Leader.<br>
              I have been creating, planning, and leading events for almost two years now for this community.</p>

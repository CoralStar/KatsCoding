                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Kat "CoralStar" Taylor and I was born and raised in Dallas, TX. I started my coding career when I was just about 13 years old.
                I started playing a game called FeralHeart, a roleplaying / chatlands game where creators can come in and build their own worlds, objects, character items, etc.
                It fascinated me that I could learn and create worlds from my imagination with just a few clicks and code. And that's where things took off! I became one of the game's most popular
                level designers within just a few years. By 2018, I had received a commission from the developers asking me to work with them on a large update to the main game.
                For something that was just a hobby, I got paid for it for the very first time. And that's when it hit me: I could make a career out of this!</p>

            </div>
            <p>I took a break from coding for some time while I was in college, and by late 2019 I finally made up my decision to get busy learning about coding. I started taking small classes on Udemy.com that taught the
              basics of C# and how to use Unity for games. Shortly after my first class, I published my first game that was later published onto the Google Play Store. While starting on my second game, I got an itch to learn
              even more! I started classes on Skillcrush.com to learn about making websites, and even started learning about Python to code bots on Discord with a friend. <br>
              Now I try to help others out by offering my services to those who need websites or help on games. Check out my work under the "Work" tab!</p>
